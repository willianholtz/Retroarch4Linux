//    Koko-aio shader is meant to be an all-in one crt shader.
//    It can be configured with many parameters, so that can be
//    scaled to run on even on modest gpus while still developed to
//    run with heavier presets on at least Haswell+ iGpus.
//    It is not meant to simulate the internal behaviour of CRT displays,
//    but to give users the parameters to make their monitors to look similar.
//    Several presets are included.

//    Actually it provides emulation for:
//        scanlines, screenlines, RGB vertical masks, horizontal slot masks,
//        glowing, haloing, blooming, gamma and SATURATION correction,pixel_outi        
//        black frame insertions, interlace emulation, antialiasing.

//    External code by:
//    * Nvidia (FXAA)



    
// Bezel texture contains the following infomations:
//   - The red channel represents the luminance information
//   - The green channel represents the highlights
//   - The alpha channel in the inner frame represents the part of the bezel that will be filled by the game content
//   - The blue channel represents the part of the bezel that will be filled by the game reflection.
