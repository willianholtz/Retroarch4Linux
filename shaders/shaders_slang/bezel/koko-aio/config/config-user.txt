// THIS FILE IN UNSUPPORTED on Retroarch > 1.19.1 IN FAVOUR OF config-user-optional.txt

// Assuming retroarch is >= 1.19,
// This file WOULD BE OVERWRITTEN by an update, so it is now unsupported
// in favour of the new config-user-optional.txt
// Retroarch > 1.19.1 users have to migrate the usage of config-user.txt to config-user-optional.txt
// the syntax is the same.

// Old version Retroarch users can continue to use this file, instead.
