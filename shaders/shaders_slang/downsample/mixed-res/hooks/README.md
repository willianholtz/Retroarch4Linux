# Mixed-Res hooks

These two presets allow almost any crt shader to be used with a game emulated at 4x  internal resolution.

How to use:

1. Load a crt preset;
2. Disable any curvature feature;
3. Prepend "mixed-res-4x-prepend.slangp" preset;
4. Append "mixed-res-4x-append.slangp" preset;
5. Change any param you desire and save your preset for future usage.

Obs: curvature or any other warp features won't work with this method.
