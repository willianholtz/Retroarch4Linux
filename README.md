# The best of Retroarch for Linux Project
Retroarch configured for Arch Linux and Linux in general.

# Initial setting
Download retroarch on your Linux, the default system settings are always in /home/user/.config/retroarch.
The configuration of this repository is already pre-configured to point directly to ~/.config regardless of the active user.

# Be part of the project
Do you want to be part of the project and make the retroarch linux version even more complete and beautiful? Get in touch with me or you can also create a fork for another project parallel to mine!

## Linux modification
Retroarch was configured from scratch, using some packages found on the net, such as:
- Wallpaper from Crazymac project
- Bezzels for all games
- Mega Bezels pack for shaders (CRT) and configured without TV curvature (Default comes with curvature)
- All roms (games) have their overlays (roms not included!).

## Games (Roms)
Roms must all be NO-INTRO or REDUMP (RECOMMENDED), or edit all the roms you download.

- [Redump](http://redump.org)
- [No-Intro](https://no-intro.org)

All roms should be REDUMP preferably, thus making retro arch configuration files with playlists.lpl and core configs (OVERLAYS) defaults.

## BIOS
Bios are in the system folder, but only what is necessary for this project to work, if you want to change, or use other bios, use Google to do so!

## TIP 1: You can found roms in archive.org.
## TIP 2: Retroarch does not use MAME emulators, only FBNeo, and all roms work perfectly (as far as I was able to do the tests) so avoid using the MAME core (any of them, as you won't need it). There is a rom pack, which has 16GB with all the perfect roms, you can find it using the following keywords: Final Burn Alpha v0.2.97.43 Merged Arcade Roms Only (Torrent)
